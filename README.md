# Jotform Autofill
Automate filling in web forms
    I made this project because I've found problems in filling timesheet form.</br>
    1) I can't copy and paste multiple textforms at once. so we have to copy and paste one by one.</br>
    2) And also I have to fill this form every month and record what i did in every day. so why we not automated filling it?</br>
    3) This is not seriously but well just try it works.<br/>

# How to use it?
    1) Clone this project.
    2) Download your timesheet as CSV File (.csv) and then move inside this folder.
    3) Run main.py and it will generate script.txt.
    4) Open Jotform URL, right click > Inspect > Console.
    5) Copy text from script.txt and then paste to console and enter it.
    6) Done :D
