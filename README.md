# Jotform Autofill
Automate filling in web forms
    I made this project because I've found problems in filling timesheet form.</br>
    1) I can't copy and paste multiple textforms at once. so we have to copy and paste one by one.</br>
    2) And also I have to fill this form every month and record what i did in every day. so why we not automated filling it?</br>
    3) This is not seriously but well just try it works.<br/>
