# jotform_autofill
Automate filling in web forms
    I made this project because I've found problems in filling timesheet form.
    1) I can't copy and paste multiple textforms at once. so we have to copy and paste 1 by 1.
    2) And also I have to fill this form every month and record what i did in every day. so why we not automated filling it?
    3) This is not seriously but well just try it works.
